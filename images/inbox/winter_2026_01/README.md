# Batch: winter_2026_01

Drop image files here (`.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.gif`, `.webp`).  
When you push to GitHub, the image-ingestion workflow will:

1. Update `batches/winter_2026_01.json` with any new images
2. Commit the ledger so the Slack bot and team stay in sync

Do not rename images after upload — filenames are used as stable IDs.
